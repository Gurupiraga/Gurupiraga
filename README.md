employee demographics, attrition rates, and performance metrics.
‚Ä¢ Data Scope: Analyzed a dataset comprising 1470 employees, including 237 cases of attrition, resulting in 1233
active employees.
‚Ä¢ Key Metrics: Utilized visualizations to track trends and identify talent, with an average employee age of 37 years.
‚Ä¢ Impact: Empowered data-driven HR decisions by pinpointing areas for improvement, thereby fostering a highperforming workforce..

2. **Sales Effectiveness Analysis**:[Project Link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1GKT-k6h71-Tz5uRqFvQTjtC60tyxX3nu?usp=drive_link) **Project Description**: The purpose of this project is to understand the relationship of each variable with
outcome variable using graphs and generate useful information for the client.
‚Ä¢ Spearheaded machine learning modelling and evaluation, achieving a remarkable 74% accuracy with
XGBoost
‚Ä¢ Elevated lead categorization, directly contributing to a significant 15% enhancement in sales
performance for FicZon Inc..

3. **Liver Patient Prediction**:[Project Link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1hmHLQq5wIIMmD79ZoSh31nf25fMCHVKb?usp=drive_link) ‚Ä¢ **Project Description**:Developed a comprehensive machine learning framework for predicting liver disease,
incorporating various algorithms such as SVM, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and
ANN.
‚Ä¢ Data Scope:Utilized diverse medical datasets containing relevant features and patient information to train
and validate the predictive models.
‚Ä¢ Impact:Achieved a notable 78% accuracy in predicting liver disease, offering potential benefits in early
diagnosis and intervention for improved patient outcomes.

4. **Rice Leaf Disease Prediction**:[Project Link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/179ckNVHhVDts_1lE5oAKuMjtxnDlj7n2?usp=sharing) ‚Ä¢ **Project Description**: Developed a CNN-based model for rice leaf disease prediction, leveraging deep learning
techniques to classify diseases such as leaf blast, bacterial blight, and brown spot.
‚Ä¢ Data Scope: Trained the model using a dataset containing 120 images of disease-infected rice leaves, categorized into
three classes: Bacterial blight, Brown spot, and Leaf smut.
‚Ä¢ Accuracy and Optimizers Used:
‚Ä¢ Utilized various optimizers including ADAM, RMSprop, SGD, and Adagrad.
‚Ä¢ Achieved the highest accuracy of 89.65% using the ADAM optimizer, outperforming other optimizers..

5. **Employee Performance Analysis**: ‚Ä¢ **Project Description**:
‚Ä¢ INX Future Inc embarks on an employee data analysis project to uncover underlying factors affecting performance.
‚Ä¢ The project aims to provide actionable insights for HR decision-making while preserving employee morale and the
company's reputation.
‚Ä¢ Data Scope: Dataset encompasses 1200 employee records with 28 features, meticulously cleaned for analysis.
‚Ä¢ Impact: Analysis yields actionable insights for HR, preserving morale and enhancing decision-making, with the
Random Forest Classifier achieving the highest accuracy of 92.50%..
