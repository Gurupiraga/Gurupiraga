- **Project Description**:Developed a comprehensive machine learning framework for predicting liver disease,
incorporating various algorithms such as SVM, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and
ANN.
- **Data Scope**:Utilized diverse medical datasets containing relevant features and patient information to train
and validate the predictive models.
- **Impact**:Achieved a notable 78% accuracy in predicting liver disease, offering potential benefits in early
diagnosis and intervention for improved patient outcomes.

6. ## **Rice Leaf Disease Prediction**:[Project Link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/179ckNVHhVDts_1lE5oAKuMjtxnDlj7n2?usp=sharing)
- **Project Description**: Developed a CNN-based model for rice leaf disease prediction, leveraging deep learning
techniques to classify diseases such as leaf blast, bacterial blight, and brown spot.
- **Data Scope**: Trained the model using a dataset containing 120 images of disease-infected rice leaves, categorized into
three classes: Bacterial blight, Brown spot, and Leaf smut.
- **Accuracy and Optimizers Used**:
‚Ä¢ Utilized various optimizers including ADAM, RMSprop, SGD, and Adagrad.
‚Ä¢ Achieved the highest accuracy of 89.65% using the ADAM optimizer, outperforming other optimizers..

7. ## **Employee Performance Analysis**:[project link 1](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1mWWcpidt6wMr8GlwrcjGJLErh-ad6lpT?usp=sharing) [Project Link 2](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Lh0UykUkRvNCeRMGoD6nWhMp9jP97DKv?usp=sharing)
- **Project Description**:
‚Ä¢ INX Future Inc embarks on an employee data analysis project to uncover underlying factors affecting performance.
‚Ä¢ The project aims to provide actionable insights for HR decision-making while preserving employee morale and the
company's reputation.
- **Data Scope**: Dataset encompasses 1200 employee records with 28 features, meticulously cleaned for analysis.
- **Impact**: Analysis yields actionable insights for HR, preserving morale and enhancing decision-making, with the
Random Forest Classifier achieving the highest accuracy of 92.50%..
